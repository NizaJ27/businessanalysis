## 2. Core Strategy

### 2.2 Arbitrage (Market Opportunity)
- **What gap/inefficiency are we exploiting?**
  The abundance of free but unstructured travel information online, which is time-consuming and difficult to verify.
- **Why does this gap exist?**
  Information is scattered across forums, blogs, and social media; travelers lack time, trust, and tools to organize it efficiently.
- **How do we profit from it or create disproportionate value?**
  We package high-value, verified insights into professional, convenient guides and sell them at low cost per unit, with optional bundles to increase cart value.

### 2.3 Leverage (Internal + External)
**Internal Leverage:**
- Digital creation and delivery tools (ChatGPT, Canva, Gumroad, Carrd/HTML)
- Automated content packaging and scalable digital distribution
- SEO and content marketing

**External Leverage:**
- Travelers’ desire for authenticity, simplicity, and feeling “in the know”
- Urgency to avoid tourist traps and maximize limited travel time
- Trust in peer-verified, insider recommendations

These levers allow Offmap to scale efficiently, convert motivated travelers, and outperform generic travel content providers.
