# Offmap Website Project — Strategic Breakdown

## Value Proposition
Offmap helps travelers explore smarter by offering curated, insider-led travel guides that start with a free gem and finish with a trusted, paid roadmap.

**Key benefits:**
- Avoids tourist traps
- Offers local insights that are hard to find without deep searching
- Instant, mobile-optimized, and affordable
- Begins with value through embedded free tips

## Arbitrage Model
Offmap profits through information arbitrage: transforming free or scattered travel info (from Reddit, Google Maps, forums, blogs) into structured, convenient, and marketable digital products.

**How it works:**
- Source high-value information from public channels
- Package it into professional, organized, trustworthy guides
- Sell them via Gumroad at low cost per unit
- Users pay for time saved, structure, trust, and clarity
- Optional: Offer bundles (e.g., regional multi-city packs) to increase cart value

## Leverage Model
Offmap leverages:
- Digital creation and delivery tools (ChatGPT, Canva, Gumroad, Carrd/HTML)
- Free or low-cost marketing channels (Reddit, SEO, TikTok)
- Customer psychology — driven by the desire for authenticity, simplicity, and feeling “in the know”

Create once, sell infinitely. It’s scalable without physical overhead.
